# DevOps Productivity Stack

This repository documents my personal productivity stack inspired by real DevOps team workflows.

## Tools Used
- Google Calendar – Task tracking & meetings
- AFFiNE – Projects & notes
- Slack – Team communication

## Why this stack?
- Matches real industry tools
- Lightweight & scalable
- Easy to explain in interviews

## Workflow Overview

- Google Calendar is used for daily tasks, reminders, and meetings.
- AFFiNE (Cloud) is used for project planning, documentation, and notes.
- Slack is used for communication and collaboration, similar to real DevOps teams.

## Real-World Relevance

This setup mirrors how modern DevOps teams work by separating:
- Time management (Calendar)
- Knowledge & project tracking (AFFiNE)
- Communication (Slack)

This helps simulate industry workflows even as an individual learner.
