# Google Calendar – Task & Time Management

## Purpose
Google Calendar is used as the central place for managing:
- Daily tasks
- Learning schedules
- Meetings
- Deadlines

## How I Use It

### Task Management
- Tasks are created using Google Tasks inside Calendar
- Tasks are grouped by purpose (DevOps Learning, Projects, Personal)
- Tasks are all-day items (no fixed time)

  - DevOps study sessions
  - Project work sessions
  - Reviews and planning

### Naming Convention
**Examples**
- `AFFiNE : Create project overview`
- `GitHub : Commit documentation`
- `DevOps : Docker practice`

## Benefits

- Easy daily planning
- Works well with long-term learning goals

## Why Google Calendar
